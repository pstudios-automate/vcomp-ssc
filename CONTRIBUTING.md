# 🤝 Contributing to V-Comp SSC
Welcome to **V-Comp SSC**, the world’s first Vulkan-native operating-system compositor.  
Your contributions help refine the frontier of GPU-driven computing.

## ⚙️ Development Principles
All code in V-Comp SSC is built on four core values:

1. **Determinism —** predictable execution within 1 ms tolerance.  
2. **GPU Native —** Vulkan-first; CPU fallbacks discouraged.  
3. **Minimalism —** explicit resource control, zero bloat.  
4. **Transparency —** every subsystem documented and benchmarked.
